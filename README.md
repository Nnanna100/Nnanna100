# Ifunanya Nwogbaga â€” AI Evaluation & Applied Modeling

I build **evaluation systems** that expose real failure modes in AI and ship **reproducible, decision-grade** analytics.  
Background: PhD in Theoretical Biophysics (stochastic systems, MLE, information theory), **defense T&E** (radar), and **health-data** pipelines.

**Focus:** AI evaluation â€¢ stochastic/dynamical systems â€¢ health/defense analytics  
**Contact:** <inwogba1@alumni.jh.edu> Â· [LinkedIn](<https://www.linkedin.com/in/ifunanya-nwogbaga-phd/>) Â· [Google Scholar](<https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IQKczu8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao>)

## Highlights (impact)
- Designed training data for LLMs, surfacing **â‰¥75% failure** on multi-step reasoning; created **gold standard rubrics**.
- Built **end-to-end health-data pipelines**, from intake and labeling to bias checks and model evaluation, with ablation studies and auto-generated, reproducible reports.
- Published paper-backed simulations of cellular electrotaxis (Soft Matter, Phys. Rev. E, Biophysical Journal); open, runnable code.

## What Iâ€™m working on now
- **AI Evaluation Playbook**: YAML task specs â†’ runs â†’ **HTML failure taxonomy** (goal completion, handoff rate, latency, WER).
- **Voice-Agent Eval Harness**: synthetic call generator + ASR/LLM policy toggles + p95 latency & $/successful task.
- **EHR ML Pipeline (synthetic)**: HIPAA-style data flow with **bias checks** and one-command reproducibility.

## Results (TL;DR) â€” example pattern to use in each repo
| Metric | Baseline | This repo | Î” |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Orientation error (deg, â†“) | 23.1 | 17.4 | âˆ’5.7 |
| Handoff rate (pp, â†“) | 32.0 | 18.5 | âˆ’13.5 |
| Latency p95 (ms, â†“) | 820 | 690 | âˆ’130 |

> Keep numbers truthful; if you donâ€™t have baselines yet, state what the table will show when the pipeline is run.

## Reproducibility & project hygiene (how my repos are structured)
- `environment.yml` or `requirements.txt` (pinned versions)  
- **One-command run:** `make run` â†’ regenerates a figure/report into `figures/` or `reports/`  
- `src/` (typed, docstrings) Â· `notebooks/` (export plots) Â· `tests/` (at least 1 smoke test)  
- CI badge (GitHub Actions) that runs tests on push Â· fixed random seeds  
- Data: synthetic/de-identified; no PHI/PII checked in

### Notes for reviewers
If youâ€™re skimming: start with **Physical-limits-on-galvanotaxis** (one-command repro), then open **ai-evaluation-playbook** for the generalized eval harness philosophy I use on AI systems.
